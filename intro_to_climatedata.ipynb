    "## Course objectives and philosophy\n",
    "Let's start by recalling what the learning objective of the Environmental Data modules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science\n",
    "2. Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories\n",
    "3. Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.\n",
    "4. Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll note that these objectives address a progression of skills. The first focus on technical competency (understanding common data format and an ability to manipulate these data). The last two go deeper than technical competency - these aim to develop a data analysis workflow. In real-life situations, some of that workflow will be informed by intuition, and the best workflow will depend on context (e.g. time, infrastructure available) and on the objectives of a study. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition will come with experience, and therefore, also from failure! This course is an opportunity to try, sometimes fail ... and therefore learn! (That is the luxury of being a student!) With that in mind, some of the coursework presented here will be purposefully \"vague\". This is not meant to be annoying, it is designed to push you to seek and explore possible solutions (solutions are rarely unique) and express your creativity as an analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Data analysis is a key component of the scientific method and therefore cannot exist without `hypothesis testing`. Approach every part of the data analysis workflow as a test, an experiment. Each experiment should be motivated by a hypothesis (a goal), will involve applying a methodology, will produce results pertinent to the hypothesis/goal, and will require a critique of these results with regards to their ability to address the hypothesis/goal before drawing a conclusion (it is ok for conclusions to come with caveats and uncertainties if the analysis warrants limits of interpretation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: Data analysis can also be a bit of  \"rabbit hole\"! There will always be nicer, cooler, better things to do. Sometimes, good is good enough though. Whatever you do, never lose sight of the overall objectives of a study. This needs to be delivered in priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This segment of the module\n",
    "In this module, content will be delivered using a mixture of\n",
    "powerpoint lectures, jupyter notebooks and practical exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: other directories, containing figures, images, animations or data are also provided. \n",
    "However, cliamte data can be very large, and github has a low limit for these. \n",
    "A dropbox link with data also exist: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fxcmtbz4o3tacz1/AABjQbeyg27zDh1chZxRDFcpa?dl=0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Github repository: `environmental_data_week1`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## We will focus and use climate data.\n",
    "This segment of the module will focus on 2D, 3D and 4D data. To illustrate techniques and learn some useful skills, we will use data around the theme of climate and climate change. As part of this, we will learn how to access and use climate data and output from global climate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The science of climate is beyond the scope of this course, but although we will focus on data analysis, it is my hope that you will develop an appreciation and better understanding of climate science in the process. \n",

    "It is ok to learn techniques and go through practicals, but the overal objective of this course is to equip you with the skills needed to pursue your own analyses. With this in mind, we are going to work towards a central question, to motivate learning though the next few lessons.  \n",

    "* ## Should French Champagne makers invest in wineries in Hampshire (UK)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, [french champagne producer Tattinger have decided to invest in a winery in Kent, called Domaine Evremond](https://www.domaineevremond.com).  Tattinger is aware that other English wineries in [Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire) are also [producing excellent sparkling wine](https://www.visit-hampshire.co.uk/food-and-drink/vineyards). \n",
    "\n",
    "Tattinger's business wing is of course concerned about this. Are these new UK wineries going to be strong competitors for them, or should Tattinger see these as investment opportunities and try to buy them while they can to establish a stronger presence in the UK market?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like everyone else, Tattinger is also aware about climate change and they realize that, from now on, they need to systematically incorporate a climate analysis as part of their business decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the growing success of English winemakers, Tattinger can see that the current climate in the Hampshire region is good enough at the moment for growing good grapes, but they want to know if and how climate change will affect the current climate in Hampshire. Ultimately, they want to know if climate change could affect the wine buisness in Hampshire. Will climate change negatively affect viticulture in the region, should we expect little change, or are conditions actually going to become even better for growing grapes in the next few decades? \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that your new start-up, as an up-and-coming climate intelligence company, is being contacted by representatives from Tattinger HQ to advise them on how climate will change in Hampshire. They want to know how climate change may affect wineries in Hampshire in the coming 50 years or so and they are looking for someone to deliver answers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to i) develop a research strategy that will answer their questions on the future of climate in Hampshire, ii) present initial results on the issue, and iii) issue a preliminary recommendation as to wether Tattinger should or should not invest in UK wineries going forward.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, time is of the essence! Tattinger has heard that [Moet-et-Chandon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moët_&_Chandon), another major champagne producer, is also eyeing on these buisness opportunities and they must make a decision quickly. **You will be expected to produce a jupyter notebook by Thursday afternoon that summarizes your analysis and recommendations to Tattinger. While you will not be required to submit this code, you will be able to refer back to it during the final assessed quiz, so doing a thorough job will help. The final quiz will certainly ask questions related to this experience, such as file formats, limitations of data, etc.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In your analysis, consider which data you want to use, how to get them (can you access and analyze them already?), what could be learned from them. Consider resolution, data use policy, data storage and analytical requirements (would you need to use a cloud service or supercomputer do perform the analysis? if so, could you use this for free as a commercial entity, if not, how much could that cost?). You may also want to use output from reanalysis products (e.g. ERA5) or climate models (UKCP18, CMIP, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Use any and all resources at your disposal (including your instructor and your classmates) but keep in mind that **this is a commercial project**, so beware of any data use or resource access policies in place. In the real world, it could be that addressing this question would imply some costs that could be passed on to the client. However, the rules for this exercise are to only use open-acess resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have much time, but this could be a big and important contract for your new company so you want to develop a good solution, ideally with some preliminary results to showcase your skills, and prove to Tattinger that you are the right people for the job. Your company could earn future business from them! \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: Although you are encouraged to exchange with your classmates and exchange ideas, source of data, and work in groups, you will only be able to rely on your own code during the quiz.** \n",

    "[ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) is  a community-led, open source, set of software tools (build on python 3) developed to improve diagnosing and understanding climate models. While the focus has been on climate models, not observations, one cannot quantify model biases without also comparing the model results with observations. [ESMValTool](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/esmvalcore/en/latest/index.html) therefore also has some capability to analyze and manipulate large datasets. \n",

    "\n",
    "* **TEXT**: Files in **text formats**, typically encoded as [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) (often UTF-8, or UTF-16), simply have bytes that can be interpreted as text characters. ASCII represents the first 128 charcters of UTF-8, so ASCII is a subset of Unicode. ASCII was developed as 7-bit code, but since UTF-8 kept the ASCII definitions when moving to 8-bits, UTF-8 (and subsequent) are backwards compatible with ASCII. Text formats are very attractive and useful as the file content is directly human-readable but this only works well for small files because data storage of such data is inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **BINARY**: More commonly, we will encouter files in **binary formats**. Sadly, binary files are not human-readable. They need to be interpreted, **using sets of rules set by whoever prescribed the format**. These rules have to be known to decode the data effectively (this can be a source of problem...and cause for frustration!).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Some common data formats found in environmental sciences are summarized in [this table](https://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/104-file-formats). \n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` I/O tool can handle most of them (read and write capability), as summarized in this  [table](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "`gdal`, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ([GDAL](https://gdal.org)), is also able to deal with these (and many more). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most imporant, or common, file formats in climate studies are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `.csv`: These are comma-separated-values,i.e text separated by commas. This format (or the related tab-delimited text format) is typically used for small datasets, such as when saving an Excel spreadsheet into a format useful for other programmes. Certain data-loggers can also produce text-based datasets. Data in this format will tend to be in the form of small tables or as 1-D data, such as time-series data.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. `.hdf`: The so-called [Hierarchichal Data Format](https://www.hdfgroup.org) is the format commonly associated with satellite imagery, where they typically hold raster data. HDF files tend to be very large and can have quite complex structure. The current version is `HDF5`, which differs from legacy `HDF4`. Common HDF file suffixes are: .hdf, .h4, .hdf4, .he2, .h5, .hdf5, .he5. `pandas` is able to read HDF data into `python` using [`pandas.read_hdf`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_hdf.html). The more specific `h5py` python package ([HD5 For Python](http://www.h5py.org)) could provide more control, if needed.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. `.nc` : NetCDF files are a typical format for gridded datasets with more than one dimension (i.e 2D to ND data), for example data with a latitude, longitude, depth/altitude and certain values. It is the data currency format used to exchange climate model outputs. Note, this does not mean that raw output of climate models comes as `.nc` files. Generally, models use their own binary formats during computation, to improve speed and storage. Results are only transformed into convenient `.nc` format at the end, where the goal is data communication and interpretation. The [`xarray`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) python library is tailored to work with `netCDF` data formats.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. `grb`: [GRIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB) files, which stands for 'GRIdded Binary' or 'General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary form', are often used in meteorology. They are the types of files used by ECMWF. There have been 3 versions: i) version 0 is legacy, no longer in use, version 2 is slowly replacing version 1, but version 1 is used by most meteorology center today. The [`cfgrib`](https://github.com/ecmwf/cfgrib) python library from ECMWF will help translate `.grb` into `xarray`, `netcdf` or `hdf`. Alternatively, the [`pygrib`](https://github.com/jswhit/pygrib) python package will provide a way to read .grb files, and modify existing ones, but not create them.\n",

    "There is no upper limit as to what information should be included in the metadata, but typical metadata comprise information about when and where the observations, or the file, where produced, how they were produced (which instrument, technique, algorithm were used), information about the experiment the data come from, maybe some information about data accuracy (if not provided as seperate data in the file), information about who produced the data or the file, including contact information, or appropriate reference(s), and, if relevant, additional information about the research context, i.e. which project is associated with these data (this could help the user understand if more data from this group/project exist or can be expected). If the data represent a subset of a larger dataset, this should also be mentioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another key pieces of information that the metadata should provide are a description of the variables in the file, with variable **names**, and the **units** of these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data in the file represent a processed version of other raw data, then one should add information about these raw data as well, their provenance, references, and the transformation that was made, etc. One should be able to track the chain of information all the way to the orginal observations (or model output). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data represent gridded variables, then the nature of the grid on which these data are defined should also be explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the position, or some other features of the data, depend on a reference system, that reference system should be given. This will be discussed in more depth during the introduction to geostatistics lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of climate models (or other models, if relevant), the metadata should also include information about the model itself, the model name, version, the length of the integration, maybe a brief description of the spin-up, boundary conditions, initial conditions used to produce the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the information that will be included in the metadata vary substantially. You should learn (and will discover - mostly through shear frustration when key information is missing!) what constitute useful metadata in your field of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata can be included in the file itself (if the file format allows it), as separate files, or in the form of some other documents. When sourcing data, always make a note of where the data come from. This is especially true if getting data online as it is very easy to download data and then forget where they come from. Detailed note-taking is part of the job of the data analyst (and that of any scientist!). \n",
    "\n",
    "When metadata is included in the file directly, this typically comes as a header, or in a specified location in the file. The netCDF format has rules for how/where to include metadata, which is one of the reason why netCDF data are particularly useful and popular in climate science. \n",

    " * ### The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (prominent in climate science)\n",
    " \n",
    "Given the amount of data produced keeps increasing, data libraries are being developed. As in any library, certain sets of rules are required so that the data can be found later. Metadata are obviously a good way to ensure data can be catalogued and found by various search systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple types of conventions exist (see for example this [list of netCDF conventions from Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html)). Ensuring that data files are produced in a way that follows conventions about content, vocabulary used and layout, allows for batch processing, easy extraction and automation! It is extremely useful (but should not prevent innovation).\n",
    "\n",
    "CEDA, as it focuses on climate and environmental data, relies extensively on the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). The CF Conventions are probably the most popular in climate science (it underpins the modelling effort of the IPCC). A detailed description of the latest release of the CF Conventions for netCDF can be found [here](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The CF Conventions were designed specifically for the netCDF format but they can be applied widely. The netCDF format enables creation of self-describing datasets by design. CF Conventions aim to ensure that  files contain sufficient metadata that they are self-describing in the sense that each variable in the file has an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time. (Absence of such information in early (historical) datasets has hindered climate change science for decades - how does one measure change, if one cannot locate the observations in time and space?)\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of CF Conventions is to provide a list of **standard_names** for certain commonly-used variables. The [CF standard name table] (http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) will show what the names are and describe what they represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, imagine you work with data at the earth surface and label your variable 'temperature'. What did you mean exactly? Surface temperature of the ocean/land, or air temperature? etc. CF conventions ensure that climate scientists name common variables in the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "A [python package](https://pypi.org/project/cfunits/) called `cfunits` provides an interface to the CF Convention. This is useful to combine and compare variables and convert various units. By relying on a package, fewer user-errors are made.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The CF Conventions are not fixed, they are evolving depending on needs and scientific progress. Although conventions are decided by a committee of experts, anyone can propose a change to the convention by engaging in the [discussion forum](https://cfconventions.org/discussion.html).\n",

They are slighly less memory/speed efficient than NCO, but they do more (>600 vs 12!). CDO support the main data formats used in the field, such as GRIB and netCDF. \n",

    "[*ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.Quality-assured monthly updates of ERA5 (1979 to present) are published within 3 months of real time. Preliminary daily updates of the dataset are available to users within 5 days of real time.*](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)\n",
    "\n",
    "[ERA5](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5) is a [family of datasets](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets). It currently comprises ERA5, ERA5.1 and ERA5-Land. ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1950 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service ([C3S](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151530614)) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)) and made available via the [Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu). \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, ERA5 is a [**reanalysis product**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGobvUGl24), meaning a **model that assimilates data**. A model of the climate (weather) is run, and adjusted (following certain laws of physics and constraints) to fit [as many observations](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Observations) as possible using a technique called 4D-var. One must realize that, even if assimimated prodcuts such as ERA5 are often used 'in lieu' of observations, they are **\\*not\\*** observations: they are a model product, but a product that is made to look as much like the data as possible given computational, mathematical, physical limitations of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "ERA5 is one of various [reanalysis products](https://reanalyses.org) available globally. Another well-known produce is the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCEP/NCAR_Reanalysis). [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), produced by NASA, is another. \n",
    "\n",
    "The article by [Hersbach et al. 2020](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.3803) discusses the ERA global Reanalysis prodcuct in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "While observations are only available in specific locations and at specific times, the reanalysis product provides a clever way to dynamically interpolate between these observations. ERA5 also comes as a gridded product, making it very convenient to use. In the model-world, one can access a complete/global picture every time-step, with a spatial resolution as high as computational limits allow. I re-emphasize that this is not the same as observations! ... but it is as close to observations as we can get if one is trying to work with a spatially and temporall interpolated product. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid geometry depends on data format**: Note that the grid geometry of the output data of ERA5 [depends on the format the data that are being downloaded](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+What+is+the+spatial+reference). Native GRIB format data are delivered on the model's native grid geometry (this is not a regular lat/lon grid!). On the other hand, data in NetCDF format are automatically interpolated and regridded to a regular lat/lon grid. While this is not very important for most application, one must remember that interpolated data in the NetCDF files are not the same as the original model output and this could have implication for the conservation properties of some variables. It can be easier/convenient to work with data interpolated on a regular lat/lon grid, however.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid definition and wrap-around**: The gridded ERA5 archive is provided on a [-90;+90] latitude grid and a [0;+360] longitude grid, with decimal degrees, referenced to the Greenwich Prime Meridian. While latitude is generally not an issue, care must be taken when working with longitude as one must remember that 0 and 360 are the same point. One must account for the wrap-around issue: although the first column and last column of a datasets on the [0;+360] grid are far away from each other in terms of index, these points are geographically very close. Some software can automatically deal with this wrap-around and convert to [-180;+180] or other system as required, but this should not be taken for granted. \n",

    "### Downloading ERA5 via the Climate Data Store (CDS)\n",
    "The instructions to download ERA5 data are [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5). There are two ways to download data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The simplest (if one only need to do this once), is to use the [web interface](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. However, one can also download ERA5 via installation and understanding of yet another service and its [API](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5#HowtodownloadERA5-3-DownloadingonlineERA5familydatathroughtheCDSwebinterface), namely, the [Climate Data Store API](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+infrastructure+and+API). (Beware, the installation instructions depend on the operating system). This provides the user with a mechanism to write data request scripts to download files automatically (or as necessary whithin a workflow). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The CDS API\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note that before using this service, one must first register for a free CDS account [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register)**. Registration is fast, only a minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to setup the uid:API key detail, as prescribed in the installation instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then install the CDS API itself; follow the instructions [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). (Note, this can also be done with [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cdsapi): `conda install -c conda-forge cdsapi`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Copernicus Climate Change Service [provides tutorials and training material](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/COPSRV/CDS+web+API+%28cdsapi%29+training) on the CDS API. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following shows an example of how one can download Air Temperature, here on the 1000 hPa pressure level, for a given time point in both NetCDF or GRIB format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the CDS web interface can be used to build the CDS API download script. In the web interface, in the `Download data` tab, after selecting some files of interest, one can click the button `Show API request` at the bottom left, which will generate a script. This script can then be modified easily as required (for example, to access similar data from different dates - what would be convenient if building a self-updating dashboard, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "One can also study the systematic structure of the ERA archive to build CDS API scripts more [efficiently](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+documentation#ClimateDataStore(CDS)documentation-Efficiencytips). \n",

    "* ## UKCP18: latest high resolution model output for the UK\n",
    "[UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index) stands for UK Climate Projections. UKCPs uses climate models to provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate may change in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "[UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about) represents a set of high resolution climate projections for the UK and the globe ('18' because this was released in 2018). It is an update of UKCP09 (done in 2009). \n",
    "\n",
    "UKCP18 provides model projections of climate change until 2100 over the UK at resolutions ranging from 2.2km, 12km, and also provides global projections at 60km resolution. Although 2.2km resolution is only available in some region, we note that is rougly the resolution used for weather forecasting! ... but in this case, the forecasts were carried forward for about a century (i.e. that's a lot of data)! This nesting, or resolution enhancement, allows the model to resolve localised high-impact events, such as heavy rainfalls. UKCP18 also comes with a set of marine projections of sea-level rise and storm surge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although UKCP18 is 'just' a model product, it is based on consistent physics and the products presents the best tool available today to try to tease out the likely effect of climate change on the UK in the next few decades. [UKCP18](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/about)  simulations are intented as a tool to help decision-makers in the UK to assess exposure to climate risk.  It is part of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing UKCP18 data\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for downloading UKCP18 data are available [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data). The UKCP18 project provides a [web-interface](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home) to facilitate data download, but this doesn't contain all the data. The full data is accessible from [CEDA](http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/?q=ukcp18&sort_by=). \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing the data through the web-interface requires registration (this only takes a few minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a UKCP Web Processing Service (WPS) that can be used to build Apps, and a python [API](https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/help/api), [`ukcp-api-client`](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-api-client), is available from git that allows remote applications to talk directly to the UKCP service to submit requests for products.   \n",
    "\n",
    "[Data availability](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18_data_availability_jul-2021.pdf): The resolution (temporal and spatial) of data available to download varies between domain (ocean, land, atmosphere) and what is available depends on what service is used to access the data (the full archive is available through CEDA...but this may not be the easiest way depending on what information we are looking for!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: will the weather become rainier over Imperial College London?\n",
    "Our goal here is to dowload high temporal resoluttion model output, i.e. hourly data, from UKCP18, using the web-interface. \n",
    "To use the web-interface, first create an account and remember your login credentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ADVICE**: You are strongly encouraged to install/work with a [password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager) on your computer ... you will need to create lots of accounts when working with data! It is not advisable at all to reuse passwords for multiple data servcies as one cannot guarantee the safety of each data provider.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your login account, login. We are now going to walk through the dowload procedure to access rainfall predictions for `Imperial College London`. \n",
    "\n",
    " Note, we will get the data for the RCP8.5 scenario, for two time periods, 1981-2000 and 2080-2100, and we are going to ask for the data to be saved in the CF-NetCDF format (i.e. netcdf file complient with CF conventions). Because we want two time periods, we would need to repeat the whole request procedure twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tick the following boxes in \"Product Selection\":\n",
    "1. Collection: Land projections: local (2.2km)\n",
    "2. Scenario: RCP8.5 (more on what the scenario means later)\n",
    "3. Output: Data only\n",
    "4. Climate Change Type: Absolute values\n",
    "   \n",
    "This will create a shortlist of datasets, shown on the right side. \n",
    "1. Select **\"Data: Variables from local projections (2.2km) regridded to 5km over UK for subdaily data (hourly and 3-hourly)\"**. \n",
    "2. Click on `View Details` and familiarize yourself with what the data contain. You will note the statement `We recommend that you consider results from more than one 5km grid box, i.e. you should also consider surrounding grid boxes.` Of course, the weather is highly variable, and in order to develop a spatially and temporally coherent picture of what climate change may look like in an area, in a way that account for uncertainties and variability, one should follow their advice. Because we are here only going through the process to illustrate how to get data, we will only ask for data from 1 grid box (i.e. the South Kensington area). Once you finish looking at the detail, go back (`click back` on your browser). \n",
    "3. Assuming these are the data we want, click `Submit a Request`. \n",
    "4. For \"Variable\", select `Precipitation rate (mm/day)`.\n",
    "5. On the Map, click on the `red search button`, and type `Imperial College London`. Various choices come up, pick the first one. We note that all the options are within the same 5km by 5km grid cell anyways. Remember, we are working with gridded model products here, so there is no point in choosing a location with too much detail (i.e the model can't differentiate between the Royal School or Mine or the Natural History Museum given the model resolution). \n",
    "6. On the Map, click on the grid cell with Imperial College (the grid cell should be highlighted in blue).\n",
    "7. For \"Temporal Average\", select `hourly`. This means we will get data for every hour (that's a lot of data!).\n",
    "8. For \"Time range\", we will select two periods: `1981-2000` and `2061-2080`.\n",
    "9. The next pull-down menu asks which `ensemble member` we are interested in. Choose the first one `HadGEM3-GC3.05-r001i1p00000`. \"Ensembles\" are basically replicates. In this case, the model was run 12 times! Because the weather is turbulent, the results from each ensemble will vary! A complete assessement of uncertainties associated with these results would have to consider all available ensembles, and check that the conclusions of any analysis is consistently reproduced across the ensemble set, or report a probability stating how likely the outcome is. Since we are here only doing an example (and time is limited), we will only work with a single ensemble member. \n",
    "10. For \"Data Format\", choose \"CV-netCDF\". As we know, netCDF files will come with a bunch of metadata, and this one is also conveniently compliant with \"CF conventions\" which would make automation of analysis easier. \n",
    "11. Add a title for \"Job label\". Although optional, as a scientist, you will want to keep notes of what you are doing. One suggested title could be `EDSML_UKCP18_2061-2080_precip-hourly`. \n",
    "12. Click `submit`. You will see that the web-interface now carries you to the next phase `generating output`. Don't close your browser! By clicking submit, a reqest was made to fetch the data from the data archive and to put them in a file. This can take a few minutes (>5-10 min), be patient. \n",
    "13. When ready, you will see a blue `Download` button. The file size should be about 1.4Mb (quite small, but only because we only selected data from 1 grid cell. If we were to do the analysis over the UK, the file would be much bigger!). This should look somethink like the following screenshot: \n",
    "\n",
    "![UKCP18download](img/UKCP18_download.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the other tabs (Outputs, Job Details, ASCII, XML Response) and explore these. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Repeat steps 1-12**: After the data are downloaded, click on `Edit inputs` (bottom right). Because we are looking to dowload data from two periods, we'll have to repeat the download precedure, making sure to select the correct time periods. Our goal will be to compare precipitation results over Imperial College from the historical period 1981-2000 with model prediction for the 2061-2080 period, assuming humanity achieves not reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. the RCP8.5 scenario is essentially a `buisness-as-usual scenario`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you move your downloaded files to a convenient folder, where you remember what these files are! (e.g. such as in an `output/` folder within this lecture folder)\n",
